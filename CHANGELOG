====================
1.3.2 - new widgets
====================

Note: Run upgrade-any-to-newwidgets.sql to make required changes in database

-	Added new widget "Tickets by source".
-	Added new widget "Open tickets".
-	In resource, queue and account widgets names are now sub-stringed to fit into one line.


====================
1.3.2
====================

Note: SQL schema update required!

-	Added the new widgets to the SQL file so they will be there when you upgrade, D'oh! ;-)
	Run upgrade-1.3.0-to-1.3.2.sql to fix. Thanks Luke Cook for the help!
-	Fixed a bug that caused existing dashboards to have problems with rebuilding widgets.


====================
1.3.1
====================
-	Fixed an issue with importing time entries.


====================
1.3.0
====================
-	The models now use caching. Add the cache configuration to your bootstrap.php file. This prevents zeros from showing up in your widgets while the import is running.
-	Added log levels so you can decide how much detail you want the log file to contain.
-	Added timezone configuration to the bootstrap.
-	Fixed a bug that caused wrong ticket dates to get saved into the database (thanks for the help Stephen Gibson!).
-	Specify the IPs that have access to your dashboards through the interface (see the "Settings" page).
-	Widgets now have in-place-editable titles and texts.
-	Dashboards can be set to fullscreen mode hiding the menu and title bar.
-	New widget: top 10 tickets!
-	New widget: a clock!
-	Fixed a bug that would cause change percentages of ticket statuses to display wrong numbers when no history is available.
-	Altered the import script so it only imports tickets from configured queues and it properly logs a message when any error occurs.
-	Tickets "of the future" (recurring tickets) aren't supported any longer, since they have the tendency to increase import time by several minutes.
-	Import script only imports open tickets from up till a year ago, adjustable through 'Import.OpenTickets.history'
-	Tickets now get their ID from Autotask instead of a freshly generated one.
-	Resource widget extended with hours worked.

Note: Update your bootstrap.php file with the Cache configuration (Cache::config directive in the bootstrap template)!
Note: SQL schema update required!


====================
1.2.0
====================
-	New widget: Rolling week! A history of the past week (default) showing your new vs. closed tickets per day. Available in line- and bar chart widgets.
	Configure the amount of days and the title of the widget in the bootstrap ('Widget.RollingWeek.daysOfHistory' and 'Widget.RollingWeek.title').
-	New widget: Queue Health! A history of the past week (default) showing the average days a ticket in your queues is open.
	Configure the amount of days and the title of the widget in the bootstrap ('Widget.QueueHealth.daysOfHistory' and 'Widget.QueueHealth.title').
-	New widget: Amount of Tickets that violate their SLA!
-	Restructured the Dashboard layout. You can now re-order the dashboard in any way you want :-)
-	iPad is now handled as desktop, not mobile.
-	Queue Health now shows the amount of overdue tickets.
-	Accounts show max 4 instead of 10 records, preventing messing up of the grid.
-	The dashboard view is now being cached. After the data has been (re-)fetched the cache gets invalidated and the dashboards rebuilt. No more half-full dashboards!
-	The date and time of the last import are shown in the title bar.
-	Fixed issue that would cause errors when fetching more then 500 tickets.
-	Cronjob now properly logs errors that occur in queries to the Autotask API, like invalid credentials or wrong domain for the autotask user.
-	The bootstrap now contains an explanation on which API locations to choose.
-	Added link to "View Dashboard" on the success message after editing a Dashboard.
-	Fixed lame ass error message issue when not selecting any resources or queues at all.
-	Added missing table header on the Dashboard index.

Note: SQL schema update required (upgrade-1.1.1-to-1.2.0.sql)!


====================
1.1.1
====================
-	"Missing Issue Type" now looks for tickets where sub issue type simply isn't set at all (in addition to a custom sub issue type ID).
-	Cronjob is no longer affected by the API limit of 500 tickets and now fetches unlimited amounts of tickets.
-	Cronjob now logs the creation of Accounts, Queues, Resources, Ticket Statuses and Sub Issue Types.
-	In addition to a single sub issue type ID you can now add multiple ID's. Set 'MIT.subIssueTypeIds' in your bootstrap.php. Please use this setting as 'MIT.subIssueTypeId' will become deprecrated in the future.
-	Kill Rate didn't take into account the unassigned tickets, neither did accounts and "Missing Issue Type".
-	Added a check on the SOAP extension. If SOAP isn't available it's being logged to both the error.log and cronjob.log.
-	Added a check on your API credentials. If you forget to enter something it's being logged to both the error.log and cronjob.log.
-	Fixed empty array checking in the list views (queues, resources, ticket statuses, sub issue types).
-	Fixed empty array checking in the Ticket Model.
-	Fixed typo in the label of unknown queue names in the queue list.


====================
1.1.0
====================
-	The totals of the "Missing Issue Type" widget didn't listen to selected resources or queues.
-	The cronjob now just fetches all freakin' tickets instead of those from Queues that you don't have ;-)
-	Queues and Ticket Statuses get imported with the label 'Not yet specified'.


====================
